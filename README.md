This started out as a clone of my [ruby-cli-skeleton](https://github.com/maxpleaner/ruby-cli-skeleton) project with the goal
of using the [wikipedia-client](https://github.com/kenpratt/wikipedia-client) gem.

I started by writing a Google search results CLI interface (a very simple one),

then wrote some methods for navigating wikipedia pages.

### How to run

`clone`, `bundle`, `./ruby-cli-skeleeton`

its that simple
